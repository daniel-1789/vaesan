## Recap
The members of the reconstituted Society learned of a "shadow play" being put on at the Witch Cat Inn several hours south of Upsala, with a note from Olaus Klint, occult investigator to meet them at the inn.  

Their research told them that Hjort was a real person, one of the last members of the previous incarnation of the Society.

After researching, they took a coach to the inn. Waiting for them outside was Klint who told them he, like them, could see the supernatural, the Vaesen. And he sensed something amiss at this inn.

The inn itself was extremely dilapidated, leaking badly in the heavy autumn rains. From speaking with Father Klarhed they learned Sami worked hard at keeping the upkeep of the inn but it seemed cursed, ever since his wife had run off earlier in the year.

When asked about a "shadow play" Sami preceded to summon his daughter and beat her, sending her fleeing up to the attic. He himself drew his shotgun, warning them about asking such questions. However, things took a turn for the strange when everyone fell asleep aside from Sami, the Society members, and judging by footsteps, his daughter Sophia. Sami retreated to the kitchen, horrified, while the Society members investigated upstairs. 

In his late wife Nora's room some magic tried to compel Egil to attack his allies, though he resisted the compunction. They found Nora's journal which told of dreams of a man killed, buried in unhallowed ground, and needing such hallowed ground to find rest.

In the attic Sophia cranked an apparatus she had built to present the Dance of Dreams as a shadow play, her voice deepening as she narrated it:

> A young man wanders through Europe, seeing things 
> few people are fortunate enough to witness. He 
> dances with queens and visits Versailles and the Palais-Royal. There people perform his plays and praise 
> his name, and life dances along like a dream. But the 
> people’s revolution sweeps the land with grenades 
> and fire, and those who were playing and singing 
> end up dead by the side of the road. The young man 
> flees the song of the guillotine.
> 
> Our hero returns home to a city in the north – he 
> walks through its gates without shoes, poor and mute. 
> The house where he was born is burnt to ashes and his 
> family is missing. He kneels by the side of the road, 
> begging for coin, and no one knows that his name 
> was once sung in the palaces of Europe.

> Suddenly he sees things no one else does – creatures creeping, flying, and crawling – as the Invisibles reveal themselves to him. When he points them 
> out to others, he is mocked and beaten.

> A man picks him up from the street and has him 
> bathed and clothed. The man’s name is Albert, and 
> his mansion is a place of love and song. Our young 
> hero performs his plays and sings to him for days and 
> nights, and they eat fruit and drink wine.
> Albert introduces his friends. In the young man’s 
> dreams they are all dancing together.
>
> But the dreams lie.
>
> It was you. You brought me here. You asked me to 
> sit down and talk. We spoke of the future of the world.
>
 I have the right to refuse, you said so and smiled, 
> and then you butchered me like a pig one hangs from 
> the ceiling. You buried my body in unholy ground, 
> without priest or consecration.
>
> Now, dreams are all I have left – I gaze out over 
> the audience at the Palais-Royal, I dance with a princess, I eat cake, I look up into your eyes, Albert, and I 
> let you take my dirty hand. You summon me to Pyri’s inn. 
> You make me a villainous proposition, and I decline.
>
> You cut me up. I scream, not wanting to die.
>
> At last you are back.
> Welcome.

With that an apparition appeared, a translucent Oscar Hjort. The names were familiar - their research had told them Pyri was Sami's grandfather, he had been innkeeper decades ago. Albert was another former Society member decades ago... Had they killed Hjort?

Speculating, they heard a thud - in his wife's room Sami had hung himself. The sleeping figures began to move - not awaken, but in their sleep head towards the Society members with intent to harm. As Nora's journal had told of burial in a root cellar they began digging in the inn's root cellar, fending off the sleeping forms of the guests and inn staff. Finding Hjort's remains they warded off his specter, declaring they would bring him rest. 

Carrying his remains to a nearby churchyard they buried him there, putting his soul at rest. Sophia traveled back with them to help serve the Society, having become one of Thursday's Children while losing her family.
