## The Invitation

The characters received a letter from their sometimes patron Linnea. 
> Dear friends,
> 
> I would be very grateful if you would visit me at the hospital at the earliest convenience, where I have had to re-admit myself following a particularly difficult period. It is a matter of great urgency, and I must also ask that you prepare for a longer journey.
>
> Yours truly,
> 
> Linnea
> 
(Note: the letter is written in shaky and barely 
legible scrawl.)

At the asylum she presented them with a letter she had recently received.


> Little Lilli!
> 
> You barely remember me, do you? The years have fluttered by like butterflies and I shall soon turn seventy. But 
> who is counting?
> 
> I wish the purpose of this letter was to renew our 
> special connection, which I have missed dearly, and 
> that I would like to see you to discuss the strange events 
> that occurred at Gyllencreutz so many years ago – and 
> though this is also true, I write to you regarding another matter.
>
> Lilli, I need your help. The situation is very dire indeed, or I would not have had the nerve to contact you. I 
> assume that you are still living in Upsala – surely you have 
> not abandoned our beloved city? Anyway, I am currently 
> located in Mölle, a small fishing village in the south. My 
> friends and I are staying at the Mölle Seaside Hotel. You 
> must come and help us Lilli – I can tell you no more than 
> that, for fear that someone else might read this letter. That 
> it must be you of all people has to do with our special secret, our way of seeing things, which brought us together 
> all those years ago.
> 
> Bring all the weapons, tools, and strange items you 
> can find. Anything might prove useful. Until then, my 
> friends and I are struck at the hotel. This is a mess of our 
> own making, but nevertheless, despite everything, I ask 
> for your help.
> 
> Love,
> 
> Your (hopefully?) dearest Oggo

(The letter was written by a person who presses 
hard with her pen and has gloriously winding 
handwriting, beautiful but barely legible to a 
modern person.)

> “THE SIN IN MÖLLE”
>
> For the past two years, the remote fishing village of Mölle in northwestern Skåne has been torn by conflict over the hotel that has opened in the area. Tourists, mainly Danish and German, are encouraged to engage in mixed-gender bathing at the beaches – something the locals are very much against.
>
> Our reporter Elias Ragnér has visited the so-called heart of sin in northern Europe – a small community at the tip of the rocky area known as The Hill in the south of Sweden. Here in Mölle, Katarina Jönsson runs a successful seaside hotel frequented by tourist from far away. Katarina tells us: “Here on The Hill, Europe’s cultural and intellectual elite meet for refreshing baths and relaxing walks in a spectacular landscape. My business is about to lead Mölle into the next century.”
>
> Many local representatives have less positive views of the hotel – especially Katarina’s decision to let women and men frequent the same beaches – at the same time! Chaplain Algot Kransvik describes it as “a very unfortunate and ill-advised project that is causing strife and promoting sinful lifestyles,” while the fisherman’s wife Anna Svensson says she “is forced to see gentlemen in suspenders and ladies in corsets, which is a sad reminder of our mortality.”
>
> In any case, your dear reporter Elias is enjoying a cold bath in the crisp waters of the North Sea – and the view on The Hill is spectacular indeed!

#### Society Archives
> THE OCCULT HERITAGE OF THE HILL
>
> Comprehensive studies of the region have unearthed a folktale regarding the genesis of the mountain itself, where farmers and fishermen believe The Hill to be the creation of, and thoroughly imbued with, supernatural energies. Supposedly, these forces caused the ground to rise from the flat clay like a volcanic rock from the sea. It is said that there are caves and ravines where supernatural energies dwell, waiting for humans and animals to be used as vessels for their manifestation into the world. It is also said that a family blessed with the Sight has watched over The Hill for centuries, to prevent its energies from taking physical form and indulging in all sorts of destructive urges. My personal studies failed to locate the family in question, on which the myth of the so called “Hill Man” is based, or any form of vaesen, but did however identify strong tendencies toward the sublime and abstract, and a strange aptitude for seeing the unseen and creating the uncreated. It seems to me that this part of the south should be strictly monitored. Perhaps a smaller headquarters should be established in the area?

### Activities

The Society members took a train for most of the journey towards Mölle, braving the frigid and snowy weather in the warm dining car. They took a stagecoach the rest of the way but no Olga was waiting for them. However, they soon found her corpse, mangled by some beast.

After informing the authorities they stayed at the Seaside Hotel. Lisa Svensson told them the owner, Katarina Jönsson, had been missing for some time. 

The investigators quickly saw through the “artist” ruse the Olga’s fellow witches were maintaining and went through Olga’s papers. One was of considerable interest:

Their examinations were interrupted by a bloodcurdling scream - one of the witches had apparently tried to leave the hotel in that cold and snowy night and was mangled to death as well. Worse, the beast that did so, was still there. It was an enormous boar - far larger than any known on Earth, with glowing eyes and massive tusks. Elsa attempted to throw a poison vial in its mouth. The bottle missed but its rolling through the snow distracted the beast long enough for Egil to open fire. Egil, though wounded by the beast managed to drive it off.

The next morning they met with the town priest, Algot Kransvik. He told them of some of the town history - including the legend of the Night Sow and that the family of lighthouse keepers were supposedly “Hill Men” who could protect the town from the mystical;. He also told them how the current keeper. Magnus Lundin, had tried to burn down the Hotel last summer, but given his role in the community, escaped with minimal consequence.

The trio braved the freezing rain and sleet that morning to reach the lighthouse. The keeper refused to let them in and holding his linden wood staff, summoned the beast. They forced the chained lighthouse door open as Togier hurled an apple he had picked up at the hotel to distract the beast. Egil opened fire while Elsa wrested the staff out of his hands. As it fell to the ground, the Night Sow, no longer under his control, gored Lundin. Togier, with great effort, broke the staff.

To their surprise, the Night Sow vanished, replaced by Katarina Jönsson, whom Lundin had cursed into the form of the Night Sow, to have his revenge on her for defiling the town with her hotel - and to use as a weapon against the witches.

They left bleeding Lundin in the lighthouse as Egil used lamp oil to light the place on fire…
